    <h1>Different Modes Categorizing Average Income Per County</h1>
    <h2>Equal Count </h2>
        <a href="maps/Equal-Count.png"></a>
        <img src="maps/Equal-Count.png" width='700px'>
    <p>The Equal Count Distribution creates intervals so that each has an equal proportion of the sample. 
        Pros: Each class will be equally represented on the map. 
        Cons: Some counts may be inequal if sample sizes are uneven, may group outliers with data and give pooer representations. </p>

        <h2>Equal Interval</h2>
        <a href="maps/Equal-Interval.png"></a>
        <img src="maps/Equal-Interval.png" width='700px'>
    <p>The Range of values are divided into intervals of the same size.
        Pros: Good for showing values that are either over or under represented
        Cons: Intervals that are over represetned will result in choropleht maps that appear mostly one color, as you can see here especially.</p>

        <h2>Natural Breaks</h2>
        <a href="maps/Natural-Breaks.png"></a>
        <img src="maps/Natural-Breaks.png" width='700px'>
    <p>Places values into naturally occuring data categories. 
        Pros: Minimizes within class variances and maximizes variance between groups
        Cons: Not good with data sets with low variance</p>


<h3>Using the total individual income in each county, and dividing that by the population in each county, I found my averaged data. 
    The reason for using this ratio is that it better represents each county because it takes into account the population differences that would skew the data.</h3>
