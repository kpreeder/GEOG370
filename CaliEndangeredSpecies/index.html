    <h1>California's Endangered Species Areas</h1>
    <p>
        These maps show the areas of three endangered species with the three bright colors.
        The thin blue lines represent the proclamation of protected lands in the state of California.
        I created a buffer around the endangered areas where they are in contact or border with very populated counties. The buffers are only present if these populated counties lie within 2 kilometers of the endangered areas.
        I also created an intersection to show where the endangered areas coincide with the protected areas. In order to do this I unioned all endangered areas together to allow me to compare them to the proclamation areas and proximity to populated counties.
        I used Census data for county populations and I selected those with +1 million population using a query. I then created a new layer containing only the populous counties.

        How are endangered species areas protected and affected by locations near populated areas?
