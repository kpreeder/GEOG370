    <h1>California's Endangered Species Areas</h1>
    <p>These maps show the areas of three endangered species with the three bright colors.
        The thin blue lines represent the proclamation of protected lands in the state of California.
        I created a buffer around the endangered areas where they are in contact with very populated counties.
        I also created an intersection to show where the endangered areas coincide with the protected areas.
